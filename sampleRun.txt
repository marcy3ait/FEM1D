***Boundary Conditions***
 
Three types of boundary conditions:
1. Dirichlet Condition- Value of displacement u is given. (Positive u in positive direction i.e. toward 0 to L)
2. Neumann Condition- Value of force F is given. (Force pointing outwards from inside the domain is positive
3. Robin Condition- F as a function of u is given. (Only linear functions of u considered i.e. spring.
   Values to be provided in this case is spring constant k and pre-compression delta
